## Project idea
Recreate a simple full-stack airbnb style site by creating the DB, backend and this frontend.
The backend can be found in my [go-mongo](https://github.com/devldm/go-mongo) repository where i have used Go and MongoDB to serve the airbnb data.  

## Project state 
While the app is far from complete and polished for now its in a state of `done` while i work on other projects. 
**Currently due to the project using a free tier for its API hosting it may timeout when clicking on a listing, This should resolve automatically once the project has become active again.**
